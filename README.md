# Campfire-Song-Shivam Khanna

Round and Round and Round we go dancing around the campfire, we run along the Mountain track with a knapsack on my back. And as we go we love to sing hee-ya hee-ya ho.

I run along the River Bank with my friends and with my snacks, And all the day we shall sing hee-ya hee-ya ho.
